There were dirt roads and hitching posts, you know. My friend went to his car (only it was a spaceship) and he got in and was digging around for something. I looked in and saw a whole lot of small boxes. He picked one out and opened it and gave me the contents and said, \" This was meant for you\". I looked in my hand and it was one of those paper weights with snow that you shake. There was a little cartoon looking Halloween scene with a cat, witch, broom, pumpkin, and a wood fence with an old oak tree behind it. "
